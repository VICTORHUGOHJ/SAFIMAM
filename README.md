# **SAFIMAM: Synthesis of Analog Filters in MATLAB by Approximation Methods**

## **by Víctor Hugo Hernández Juárez**

### **April 2024**

**SAFIMAM** *(Synthesis of Analog Filter in MATLAB by Approximation Methods)* is an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface developed in MATLAB to synthesize analog filter structures, 
based on classical approximation methods, additionally the approach with the Pascal approximation method, starting from a few design specifications is presented.

### **Requirements:**

This software only requires a basic Matlab setup. To design filters with classical approximation methods, the software requires the toolbox which is located in the 
Functions_of_classical_methods/AF_TOOLBOX_2016 folder. The toolbox supporting the book: Lars Wanhammar: Analog Filters Using MATLAB, Springer, 2009.

### **Installation:**

The software does not need any installation. It is sufficient to add the folders with subfolders to the Matlab path.

**Folder organization and quick start guide is included in SAFIMAM Documentation file in documentation folder.**
