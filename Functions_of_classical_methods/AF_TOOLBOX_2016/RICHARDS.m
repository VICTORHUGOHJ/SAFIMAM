	function [Z, KI, RL] = RICHARDS(Num, Den)		% 	Computes the characteristic impedances in a Richards' structure   	%	consisting of cascaded lossless comensurate transmission lines 	%	for an impedance Z = Num/Den, where Num and Den are polynomials 	%	in S, where S is Richards' variable. For example, Num = [ 1 2 3]	%	correspond to Num = 1 + 2S + 3S^2.	%	The last transmission line is either open-circuited, 	%	short-circuited, or resistively terminated.	%	%	The vector Z contains the characteristic impedances for the  	%	transmission lines and a possible resistive termination, RL, 	%	is given separately.	 	%	KI is a vector used by LADDER_2_H that defines the two-ports.		%	% 	Author: 			Lars Wanhammar, 2008-11-17	% 	Modified by: 	 		%	Copyright:			Divison of Electronics Systems	%	 					Dept.
